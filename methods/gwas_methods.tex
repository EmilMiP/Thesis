This section should deal with ways of improving power in the base GWAS method described above.

I imagine that an overview of shorts should be here, where computational cost, type of model, type of phenotype it accepts, what it is able to account for (relatedness, pop strats, ancestries) etc.. I believe it would be useful to also include some binary only methods (logistic reg-based methods), and survival models.


\subsubsection{Notable methodological advancements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item PLINK - linear and logistic regression
	\item BOLT - linear mixed models - handles pop strat and relatedness
	\item SPA-based methods - unbalanced case-control status
	\item Cox PH methods, SPACox
	\item GATE - frailty model
\end{enumerate}
