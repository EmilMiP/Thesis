All projects in this dissertation are based on two types of information. The first is register data and the second is genotype data. The registers are used to define the study population, acquire phenotype information for individuals, and link family members. The genotype data served as the basis for a genome-wide association study that the dissertation is trying to increase power for without increasing the sample size. 

\subsection{Danish registers}
The Danish registers serve as the main source of phenotypic information and allows us to link individuals to their family members. The registers can be linked to one another through a unique 10 digit number assigned to every Dane and resident in Denmark since 1968.  

\subsubsection{The civil registration system}
The Danish civil registration system was established on 2 April 1968, and all persons living in Denmark were registered for administrative use. All registered individuals were given a 10 digit unique personal identification number, commonly referred to as the CPR-number. The CPR-number is used to link individuals across all registers. The register holds information on name, gender, date of birth, place of birth, citizenship, identity of parents, and it will be continually updated with information on vital status, place of residence and spouses. On 1 May 1972 all persons living in Greenland were also included into the register. \cite{pedersen2011danish}

\subsubsection{The national patient register}
The Danish national patient register was established in 1977. Its contents has been expanded several times since it was created. Originally, it contained only information on patients admitted to somatic wards. In 1995, the register was expanded to also include outpatients, patients from emergency rooms, and patients from psychiatric wards. In 1994, the international classification of disease, version 10, was adopted in Denmark, and prior to the adoption, version 8 was used. \cite{lynge2011danish}


\subsubsection{The psychiatric central research register}
The psychiatric central research register has valid data from 1970 and onwards. At the beginning, the register contained information on every admission to a mental hospital and psychiatric department, where information such as dates of onset, end of treatment, and all diagnosis were recorded. In 1995, the register became an integrated part of the Danish national patient register and was expanded to also record information from psychiatric emergency room and outpatient treatment. Similarly, ICD-10 codes were used after 1995, and ICD-8 were used before. Most mild and moderate disorders are treated by general practitioners or in private practices and will therefore not be in the register.\cite{mors2011danish}

\subsection{Genotype data}
This section covers the sources of genotype data used in this dissertation. There are two main sources, namely iPSYCH and UK biobank (UKBB). Here, we will provide a brief overview for each of them. Notably, the iPSYCH cohort is a Danish biobank and has been linked to the previously mentioned registers. 

\subsubsection{The newborn screening biobank}
The Danish newborn screening biobank contains dried blood spot samples from nearly every newborn since 1982. The samples are taken from a heel prick a few days after birth and are stored at $ -20 $\textcelsius. Each year about $ 65000 $ new samples are added, resulting in over $ 1.8 $ million samples in total. The purpose of the biobank is, among other things, to screen for various disease at birth. The samples are kept frozen for research purposes, and the dried blood spots provide the basis for the iPSYCH cohort. Accessing the dried blood spots for genotyping was granted after ethical approval from \textbf{LOOK WHERE APPROVAL CAME FROM}. \cite{norgaard2007storage}

\subsubsection{iPSYCH}
iPSYCH is short for the Lundbeck Foundation Integrative Psychiatric Research consortium, and it will be the primary source of genotype data in this dissertation. The benefit of a biobank such as iPSYCH is not the number of genotypes, as it is rather modest in size compared to biobanks such as UKBB (about $ 500 $k genotypes). Instead iPSYCH's strength is due to the richness of the register information that it is linked to. All of the previously mentioned Danish registers have been linked to the genotypes, allowing for a very detailed set of phenotypes, as well as information on socioeconomic status and family members.

The iPSYCH cohort has been sampled in two rounds. The first round is called iPSYCH2012 and has $ 86,189 $ samples, while the second round, iPSYCH2015i, has $ 56,233 $ samples. The combined cohort is called iPSYCH2015 and has $ 141,265 $ unique samples. The population that iPSYCH2012 is nested within is defined as all singletons born in Denmark between the $ 1^{st} $ of May $ 1981 $ and the $ 31^{st} $ of December $ 2005 $, where the mother is known and the child is alive and living in Denmark by their first birthday. iPSYCH2015i extended the study population to individuals born between $ 1^{st} $ of May $ 1981 $ and $ 31^{st} $ of December $ 2008 $ with the same conditions. In total, $ 1,657,449 $ individuals satisfy this condition. For the first round of sampling, $ 30,000 $ samples were chosen at random, creating a population representative control group. For iPSYCH2015i another $ 21,000 $ were sampled for the control group. However, due to the random sampling $ 385 $ were chosen as controls for both iPSYCH2012 and iPSYCH2015i and another $ 2,958 $ individuals had at least one of the disorders iPSYCH focuses on, and would have been sampled either way. From the study population, all individuals with at least one of the focus disorders were sampled for iPSYCH2015 resulting in $ 93,608 $ samples, and $ 50,615 $ population controls. 

\subsubsection{UK biobank}

It is difficult to overstate the importance of the UK biobank's influence on the field of statistical genetics since its release of genotypes in 2018. Most importantly, UKBB is open access, meaning it is open to researchers from around the world, regardless of whether they are from academia, charity, or commercial sectors. The biobank is also one of the largest of its kind, and it has rich phenotype information from certain registers, such as cancer and death registers. Some electronic health records have also been linked to the participants, as well as questionnaires on socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. On top of this information, the participants also provided blood, urine, and saliva samples for proteomic and metabonomic analysis.

UKBB has released about $ 500,000 $ genotypes with a wide range of phenotypic information to go along side it. After imputation, there are roughly $ 96 $ million SNPs that pass quality control. After filtering for ancestry, a list of $ 409,728 $ individuals have been released with the data, as these individuals fall in a category with very similar ancestral backgrounds. Relatedness was not recorded during the recruitment process, so relatedness filtered had to be done with kinship coefficients for all pairs of participants. The relatedness analysis showed a larger than expected number of related pairs. The increase is likely due to sampling bias, as samples were taken from 22 recruitment centres across the UK, and close living relatives would be more likely to participate if one of them recommended it. \cite{bycroft2018uk,biobank2015genotyping}
