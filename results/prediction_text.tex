The final paper does not focus on GWAS, but rather on the predictive value of the LT-FH++ phenotype as an alternative to the conventional binary family history variable in prediction models. In epidemiology, family history is a well-known and powerful predictor that has been used to improve prediction models of complex phenotypes such as mental disorders and suicide. As the intension is to provide an estimate of an individual's liability for a given disorder before getting an actual diagnosis, we will not consider the case-control status of the index person, but only the family members. In many ways this is similar to the purpose of the PRS and how it is currently being used to screen individuals for disorders. However, instead of using the individual's genotypes to acquire an aggregate genetic risk score, we will use the family history to estimate a liability. 

\subsubsection{Real-world analysis}

We will consider a base model that contains the index person's sex, age, and $ 20 $ PCs. We will add additional predictors to the base 
model and assess the additional predictive value of each predictor. From the additional predictors and combinations of them, we can 
derive the best family history variable and the best overall model. We will consider the PRS for a given disorder, as well as a binary 
family history indicator or the LT-FH++ phenotype (but with the index person's status removed). We present the results in 
\cref{fig:paper3:predictionResults}. We calculated the average partial $ R^2 $ across $ 8 $ phenotypes available to iPSYCH, but we 
left out eating disorders, as there were almost no family history available. We find that the LT-FH++ phenotype provided a $ 19.6\% $ 
increase over the the PRS model, while the binary family history variable had a predictive value $ 65.2\% $ lower than the PRS model. 
Of the models with only two predictors, the best model was the one with the PRS and LT-FH++ phenotype predictors. They had an average 
partial $ R^2 $ of $ 111\% $ across the $ 8 $ disorders, resulting in a partial $ R^2 $ value that is the sum of each predictor. 

On top of this, we will also considered correlated phenotypes. Mental disorders are notoriously difficult to diagnose and many mental 
disorders have a high genetic correlation. Accounting for correlated phenotypes is therefore an attempt at utilising the information 
from the highly correlated phenotypes to improve prediction. In order to have as fair of a comparison as possible, we also included 
the values from the correlated phenotypes for the other variables, such as a multi trait PRS model, which is a model with the PRS of 
all the considered correlated phenotypes. Similarly, the binary family history variable for all the correlated phenotypes was also 
included. For LT-FH++, we considered two scenarios. The first is the correlated phenotype extension as presented in 
\cref{sec:methods:ltfhpp:correlatedTraits}. It resulted in a single liability estimate that represents the family history for all of 
the considered disorders. We also considered a simpler approach, where the single trait LT-FH++ phenotype was included for each of the 
considered phenotypes. The first approach for LT-FH++ did not perform as well as the other methods, and will not be presented here. 
Therefore, we used the single trait LT-FH++ phenotype for each of the considered phenotypes. The multi trait results are presented in 
\cref{fig:paper3:predictionResultsMultiTrait}.

In the multi trait scenario, the LT-FH++ multi trait extension does not perform as well as multiple simple binary family history variables, but it still performs far better than a single PRS, and on par with the PRS of all correlated phenotypes. The most predictive family history model is either the model with all the binary family history variables or all the LT-FH++ phenotypes.
