This section will summarise the results of the scientific papers the dissertation is based on. All papers utilised some version of the LT-FH++, which will be referred to as age-dependent liability threshold model when no family history is being used. Each paper has its own distinct use case of the model, which will be highlighted in the coming sections.

%\begin{enumerate}
%%	\item LT-FH++: highlight Mortality and ADHD. It shows the importance of including family history and age-of-onset to increase 
%%power, but also shows that it is not the end all be all.
%%	\begin{enumerate}
%%		\item Mortality GWAS - large power increase
%%		\item ADHD GWAS - almost no power increase
%%	\end{enumerate}
%%	\item ADuLT: when only looking at age-of-onset, cox PH models are probably not the best model to use. ADuLT is \textit{never} the 
%%worst model, but also not always the best. The most robust method is ADuLT, since power is always best or close to the best.
%%	\begin{enumerate}
%%		\item simulation results with downsampling
%%		\item ADHD GWAS results
%%	\end{enumerate}
%%	\item fGRS: the predictive performance of the liabilities compared to binary variables.
%%	\begin{enumerate}
%%		\item single trait performance
%%		\item multi trait performance 
%%		\item cross ancestry performance
%%	\end{enumerate}	
%	\item Do I need a section combining the results into a larger picture somehow here ? or is it meant to go in the discussion?
